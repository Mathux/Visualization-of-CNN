Dear students,
Find here the schedule for the presentations that will take place on Jan14-15-16. There will be two parallel tracks, both taking place in Inria Paris (2 rue Simone IFF, 75012). When you enter the building tell the receptionist you are going for the presentation and go directly to the first floor (no special access card is needed).
All projects will have time for 8 minutes talk + 2 minutes questions. Note that this is a hard limit.
To minimize the time for switching between presentations, we ask you to submit a link to your presentation. We will show the slides for all projects from our computer. This link should therefore be publicly accessible. We suggest that you prepare your presentations with Google Slides, or upload a PDF file on any online platform.

Once your slides are ready, please paste your link to the schedule next to your name. Please do not modify any other part of the document. Links should be submitted prior to the presentation.
Find the presentation guidelines at the end of the last lecture slides.
You are encouraged to attend presentations of each other.
Best,
Gul
